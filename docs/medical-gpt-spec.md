# Medical GPT Specification

This document was created following the instructions from the conversation:

```
1. Create a new file `docs/medical-gpt-spec.md` describing the GPT’s purpose, core functions, and examples (using the text from the conversation).
2. Update `README.md` with a short description of the repository’s goal and a link to `docs/medical-gpt-spec.md`.
3. Commit the new documentation with an informative commit message, e.g., “Add initial medical GPT design document.”
```

## Purpose

The aim of this project is to experiment with GitHub Copilot Codex to build a medical GPT. The model will assist with automation and education in healthcare contexts.

## Core Functions

- Answer medical questions with concise and accurate information.
- Automate common tasks in medical data management.
- Provide educational explanations about medical topics.

## Example Interaction

```
User: What is the dosage of medication X for adults?
